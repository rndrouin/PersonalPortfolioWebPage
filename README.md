# PersonalPortfolioWebPage 
This project leveraged HTML and CSS using flexbox to design an adaptive web page representing a personal portfolio. It contains an about me, skills, projects, and a contact form. Some examples of the styling applied include hover styling, 
media queries that stack items under smaller screens, and basic alignment changes
